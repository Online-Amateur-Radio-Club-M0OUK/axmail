As with any of the softwares I tweek n geek, *use at your own risk*!
With that said, and the fact that this is GPL software if you find
something that's borked... don't just submit a bug report. Fix it if
you can. Rerelease it under your own callsign if you wish, or feel free
to send me your code and I'll import it in.

This is probably one of the simplest packages to install and configure!
After you run tar zxvf axmail-###.tgz cd axmail-#### (which is where 
you should be now if you're reading this :) ) and run:

make; make install
Note: If you have clamsmtp and your clamsmtpd.conf is in /usr/local/etc, 
symlink it to /etc.

(on newer gcc/libs I do know that there's a warning after it makes but
it doesn't prevent the binary from compiling and so far it seems to test 
ok. I'll fix that if and when I get the chance but don't hold your breath 
on it hi!)

cd /usr/local/etc/ax25 and using your favorite editor (vi, joe, pico, etc) and
edit axmail.conf. In here you can specify how you wish the mailbox
to handle accounting for end users. On *most* linux systems, the default
should be "ok" but if you wish to have users contact you first, or if
you wish to have the system auto-create a standard shell login, or popmail 
account for the users, etc... you may do so in the file. Double check your 
settings (it *is* possible you can configure axmail.conf so that everyone 
has root-group access... but why would you wish to do that? You've been 
*warned* so double check your config settings for auto-creation of 
accounts before saving!) The file is well commented to assist you. When 
you're finished and have become an expert, if you wish to you can delete 
the comment lines.

You may also customize the file "welcome.txt" in /usr/local/etc/ax25/ if you 
wish to also. I suggest leaving the first line as-is as this is the so called
"new user" welcome greeting email. I've supplied a basic and short 
greeting email message that users will get once they've created their 
mailbox. If you would rather new users email your mail account directly 
instead of root, you may wish to change that line.

For the software itself... believe it or not, you're *DONE*! That's all!
However... now we need to get it hooked into which ever node frontend you 
run so that users have a way of accessing it. axMail runs as an external 
process (ExtCmd) to the node. I've tested it with URONode (obviously) and 
with LinuxNode by Tomi. To do this cd /usr/local/etc/ax25 and using your 
favorite editor open node.conf and add the following line to your ExtCmds:

ExtCmd          MAil    1       root    /usr/local/sbin/axmail axmail %u
(note: MA in the word MAil is in CAPS)

Save uronode.conf and telnet in to test! It should work just fine. Since you 
would have an existing account on your server, it's unlikely that you'll 
get the welcome message, but since you can edit it, you'll know what it 
says :)

**ERROR 1**
*** Note:
If you're installing axMail-FAX via source, but your MTA (aka: postfix)
was installed from repository packaging, you may need to create a symlink
to your users mail file directory... typically: 
/var/spool/mail/ -> /usr/local/var/spool/mail/
If you don't do this, users will NOT see their incoming mail.
***

Happy mailing!
