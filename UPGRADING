If you are upgrading axmail from ver 1.0.1, all you really need to do
is copy the binary over the existing one.

** version 2.9 requires a new field to be added to axmail.conf!
make upgrade will back up your old file. You can copy it back over and
add "SysopMail    <sysop@email.address> if you wish.

If you are upgrading axMail from any version equal to or earlier than 1.0.0
back up your /etc/ax25/axmail.conf file and do a full install.
