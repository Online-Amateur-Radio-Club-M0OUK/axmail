DESCRIPTION

	This creates a signature file which would get appended to your
	outgoing mail so you don't have to keep typing your closings
	when you send mail. If you don't have a signature file it will
	inform you of such but it will not prevent mail from being sent.
	This is limited to just 1 line (79 characters).
