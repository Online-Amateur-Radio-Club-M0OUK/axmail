USAGE
        unkill <msg #>

DESCRIPTION
	The Unkill commmand allows you to reflag a killed message as
	valid so that it may be retrieved later if you wish to reread
	it. This comes in very handy in the event you accidentally kill
	or delete a mail message. Mail does NOT get fully killed until
	you exit the axMail-FAX mailbox, and your settings are changed
	and saved.
