USAGE
	Verbose <msg #>

DESCRIPTION
	Like with the Read command, verbose will print out the full mail
	headers along with the body of the message. This command requires
	a parameter consisting of the message number you wish to read.
	Ex: V 3 will verbosely print message #3 including all mail
	headers. This can be quite lengthy but also can be quite
	handy if you're trying to find out if someone else's mail
	account may have been compromised or spoofed.
